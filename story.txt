	Once upon a time there was a CS student studying in Engineering Hall at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The CS student, who went by the nickname Skippy, was approached by a man wearing an all black trenchcoat. The mysterious man knew his name and asked him if he would help him out with a small task. Skippy proceeded to ask what the task was, but the mysterious man said it must be discussed in an undisclosed location. Skippy said yes to the mans proposal as he finished all his homework for the week and had some time to kill. Skippy stood up and realized how tall the man was, he followed him out of the building. As soon as he saw the front entrance Skippy was knocked out... Skippy slowly blinked his eyes open. Getting knocked out seriously disorients a person. Skippy looked around and saw the inside of a van. Nothing restrained Skippy so he tried to open the doors but to his dismay they stayed shut. The driver of the van suddenly started speaking but Skippy could not see who it was. The driver appologized for the harsh actions but the task was too important and too risky. Skippy asked the driver what the task was. The driver only said that Skippy would aid in the retrieval of something very important. This only made Skippy more suspicious and he continued to look for a way out.
